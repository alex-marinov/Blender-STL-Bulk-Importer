# Blender-STL-Bulk-Importer

## Description

This Python script is used to create collections and import STL files in Blender using the bpy (Blender Python) library. It recursively traverses a specified root folder, creates collections for subfolders, and imports STL files into the corresponding collections.

## Usage

Replace 'root-folder-path' with the actual root folder path in the script.
Run the script in Blender's scripting interface or from the command line using Blender's --python option.

Feel free to customize this script as needed for your project.
